Alfie WP Weather is a powerful, flexible plugin that adds weather information to your WordPress website with style.

== Description ==

Alfie WP Weather is a smart plugin that adds weather information to your WordPress website. It comes with an integrated Ajax location search, so you can setup everything with just a few clicks. Every aspect of the plugin is configurable. You can choose to display minimum, custom or full weather information available, including the forecast. The plugin uses the Yahoo! API for the real-time location and weather information. The information is cached for an hour to avoid over-usage of the Yahoo! API and also to provide the fastest response times from the server.

The plugin and widget are already translated into Spanish and Romanian. More translations and cool features coming soon.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the alfie-wp-weather folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. There's no configuration needed. You can add the Alfie WP Weather widget in a sidebar like usually.
